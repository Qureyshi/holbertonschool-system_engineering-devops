Scale-up web infrastructure refers to the process of increasing the capacity and capabilities of a website or web-based application to handle more traffic and data. This can involve adding more servers, upgrading existing hardware, implementing load balancers, and using other techniques to improve the scalability and performance of the website. The goal of scale-up web infrastructure is to ensure that the website can handle increased demand without experiencing downtime or performance issues.
