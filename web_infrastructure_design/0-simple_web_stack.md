Certainly! Hereâ€™s a textual representation of a diagram showing the web stack described. This diagram outlines the single-server setup and the flow of requests:

Explanation of Diagram
User's Browser:

The user types www.foobar.com into their browser and sends an HTTP request.
DNS Server:

The DNS server resolves the domain www.foobar.com to the IP address 8.8.8.8.
Web Server (Nginx):

Nginx receives the HTTP request at IP address 8.8.8.8.
If the request is for static content, Nginx serves it directly.
For dynamic content, Nginx forwards the request to the application server.
Application Server:

The application server processes the request using the application files (codebase).
It may query the database to retrieve or update data.
Database (MySQL):

The application server interacts with the MySQL database to fetch or store data.
Response:

The application server sends the response (content) back to Nginx.
Nginx then sends the final response to the user's browser.
This diagram and explanation outline a basic single-server web stack configuration, highlighting the flow of requests and the roles of each component in serving the website.
